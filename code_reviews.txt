1. The most important similarity between the two is that the code must be a correct and effective solution. Both sources also 
say that smaller is better in a code review, so you should not put too much into each pull request and bottleneck everyoneâ€™s work. 
The yelp blog focuses more on how to review the code, pointing out the importance of proper architecture and style along with 
adequate test coverage, while the VSCode article emphasizes how to interact with other colleagues when reviewing their code. 
Another difference between the two is that the Yelp page specifies not to make any major changes to the code being reviewed, while 
the VSCode article does not mention this, instead talking more about the tone and the level of criticism in the review.

This is a good code review because the answerer is not only providing an intricate and thorough solution, but is also providing 
example code to guide the original asker of the question.


3. https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/291401/function-that-returns-activation-function-as-well-as-its-derivative
This code review is very lengthy and does not include much example code, so it makes it difficult for the original asker of the 
question to understand how their suggestions can be implemented. In order to improve this answer, example code can be included.
